What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	The repo is created.
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area is an interim place before the repository, used by commit. The working 
	directory can have lots of junk in it that may never get committed. It's a better place
	to code/test and try things out, whereas the staging area is reserved for files that will
	be committed and maybe bundled with others to be committed as a pkg.
