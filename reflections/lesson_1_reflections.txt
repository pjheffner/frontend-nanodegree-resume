diff is great for comparing files, been using it forever

the entire history of a file can help you go back to an earlier version, test from the begininng to 
the end to find out where the code broke. write new code that is similar to a previous version of code,
but not necessarily the current one

pros of manual commits - you can make them based on logical units of work
cons - you have to remember to do it and be disciplined, choose the right size unit

Git allows multiple files to be committed together b/c it's for code, google docs is not

git log lets you see what files have been committed (each commit)
git diff lets you diff the files by providing the commit numbers

version control makes you more confidnet about making changes b/c you can always go back to prev versions easily
