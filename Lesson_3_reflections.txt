When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  when you want to have a safe backup copy other than your desktop, when your project requires remote storage

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay 
up-to-date with your remote repository?
	you might want to use GitHub for finished work, so you don't want it auto pulling the changes
	that aren't ready
	
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	forks are only within github
	clones are only TO your local server (either from github or another local repo
	branches are just labels with a local repo
